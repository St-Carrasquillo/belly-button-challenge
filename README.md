# belly-button-challenge
Module 14 challenge


## Assignment
In this assignment, you will build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity datasetLinks to an external site., which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.
<p>The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.</p>

## My Work
<p>Creating the charts was relatively simple. I struggled most with connecting the drop down menu selection to the demographics info metadata card object and deploying the app to GitHub Pages.</p>
<p>I tried moving the index file out of the starter code folder and into the main folder but no matter what I tried I couldn't get the app page to appear. </p>
